## Overview

The main goal of this lab is to introduce and build an ensemble model using the `stacks` package.

Read and review the: 

- [`stacks` package homepage](https://stacks.tidymodels.org/index.html), and
- the [Getting Started with stacks vignette](https://stacks.tidymodels.org/articles/basics.html).

The vignette will be very helpful since the lab follows the general workflow outlined within it.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the questions provided in `LO7_ensemble_models.html`. A template is provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L07.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which should contain a link to your github repo. Including the github repo link takes the place of having to submit the additional qmd and r files. See canvas for submission details.
